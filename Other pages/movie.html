        <p class="description"> As a fan of vampire movies, I was thrilled when I was tasked with creating a new movie idea with a poster to go along. My aim was to create something original, avoiding the typical clich√©s and romance associated with vampire movies. Instead, I wanted to focus on the action and intensity of the storyline.
            <br><br>
            After extensive research, I came up with the idea of vampires created in a laboratory. The human race's obsession with immortality resulted in the creation of superhumans with monstrous qualities, including superhuman strength and a need for human blood to sustain life. The film centers around a classic good vs. evil conflict, where the protagonists attempt to defeat the evil vampires before it's too late, while questioning the ethics of creating these superhumans.
            <br><br>
            Creating the poster was just as important to me as the storyline itself. The design features specific buildings that are integral to the movie's setting, creating an immersive experience for viewers. The vampire safehouse with its neon bat sign, the science lab with a neon molecule sign, and a "to the moon" neon sign are all prominently displayed. The moon sign hinting at potential werewolf involvement. If you look closely, you can even find a very faint man standing at the top of the vampire building, watching over the city. 
            <br><br>
            At the top of the poster, you can see a blood moon with vampire teeth framing it, this really solidifies the movies theme. Lastly, I added the sense of movement with a splash of blood over the pearly white vampire teeth
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, I believe that my unique take on the vampire movie genre will appeal to fans of the genre while also bringing something fresh and new to the table.</p>
