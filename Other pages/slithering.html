        <p class="description"> "The Slithering Sanctuary logo was created for a fictional snake rescue center with a mission to provide urgent medical care to snakes in need. The center aims to release the snakes with the highest chances of survival back into the wild and provide a permanent home for those who cannot. It's open to the public for viewing and accepts donations, with personalized thank you cards given to donors. A gift shop raises funds for the center.
          <br><br>
          The logo combines the Celtic love knot and two intertwined serpents, with the font "Alovera" adding a serpent-like feel. The "S" resembles a rattlesnake tail. A separate logo was created for the gift shop utilizing the stems on the two "a"s in "Sanctuary."
          <br><br>
          The business package includes a letterhead, invoice, business cards, and personalized thank you cards for donors. The design maintains consistency with the same fonts, colors, corner decor, alignment, and hierarchy. Black curved corners were used to soften sharp edges, resembling a snake's curvature. Snake illustrations were created from the logo throughout the design to maintain branding consistency. The slogan "Saving snakes, one slither at a time" is featured on the front of the business card.
          <br><br>
          Overall, I enjoyed creating this business package and believe that it effectively communicates the sanctuary's mission and brand."</p>
