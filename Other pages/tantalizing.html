        <p class="description"> "I embarked on the creation of Tantalizing Designs, with an abundance of ideas buzzing in my mind. The question "who am I?" must have crossed my mind a million times, as I consider myself an artist, a problem solver, a hard worker, and a nature and animal enthusiast, among other things. Originally, I aimed to incorporate all of these qualities into one logo and started by focusing on the most important elements.
            <br> <br>
            My love for nature and self-growth, my "witchy side" if you will, served as my primary source of inspiration. Given my penchant for runes and tarot cards, I began researching symbols similar to them and came across Theban language, which I had unknowingly been using for years as its own form of communication.
            <br> <br>
            The language's perfect fit with the two letter "t" in my logo led me to experiment with various Theban "t" placements, eventually resulting in a floral design with two Theban "t"s. I was amazed to see how this symbol could resemble a beetle, butterfly, mantaray, flower, and more, making it an "all-encompassing" symbol. Moreover, it appeared like an ink blot that people could interpret themselves, a feature that I found fascinating and likely to spark interesting conversations.
            <br> <br>
            When searching for a name, I explored several "t" words, and the word "tantalizing" caught my eye. Its meaning, exciting one's senses or desires, aligns perfectly with what I aim to achieve with my brand- excitement, uniqueness, and fun. Furthermore, the name conveniently has two "t"s. The process of designing this logo was lengthy, but the gratification it brought was immense."</p>
